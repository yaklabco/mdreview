# Contributing to Design Review

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Design Review! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+
- Chrome 110+
- Git

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mdview.git
   cd mdview
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-yourname-your-feature-name
   ```

5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

6. Load extension in Chrome:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` folder

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. Make your changes in a feature branch
2. Follow the code style guidelines
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(renderer): add support for GFM tables
fix(theme): correct dark mode syntax highlighting
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
```bash
bun run test
```

Write unit tests for:
- Core functionality
- Utilities
- Converters and parsers
- Theme engine

#### E2E Tests
```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

Test complete user workflows using Playwright.

#### Coverage
Maintain > 80% code coverage for unit tests.

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
# Lint code
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format

# Run all checks (lint + test)
bun run check

# Check TypeScript types (via build command)
bun run build
# OR
bunx tsc --noEmit
```

### Git Hooks

The repository uses Husky to enforce quality checks automatically:

#### Pre-commit Hook
Runs automatically when you commit:
- **Linting**: Runs ESLint with auto-fix on staged files
- **Formatting**: Applies Prettier to staged files
- **Scope**: Only checks staged TypeScript files in `src/` and `tests/`

This is fast and ensures all committed code follows project standards.

#### Pre-push Hook
Runs automatically when you push:
- **Full Test Suite**: Runs all unit tests (`bun run test:ci`)
- **Exit Code**: Push is aborted if any tests fail

This prevents pushing broken code to CI and catches issues early.

**Note**: The pre-push hook takes ~15 seconds. If you need to skip it temporarily (not recommended):
```bash
git push --no-verify
```

#### Troubleshooting Hooks
If hooks aren't running:
```bash
# Reinstall husky hooks
bun run prepare
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. Rebase your branch on latest main:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. Run all checks (or rely on git hooks):
   ```bash
   bun run lint           # Auto-runs on commit via pre-commit hook
   bunx tsc --noEmit      # Type checking
   bun run test:ci        # Auto-runs on push via pre-push hook
   bun run test:e2e       # E2E tests (run manually if UI changes)
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you commit and push normally, the hooks will automatically run linting, formatting, and tests.

3. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

4. Ensure documentation is up to date

### Submitting
1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

3. Fill in the PR template:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issues
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)

4. Wait for review

### Review Process
- All PRs require at least one approval
